# Host a YOLOv8 model on a SageMaker Endpoint
This aim of this project is to host a [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)* PyTorch model on a [SageMaker Endpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) and test it by invoking the endpoint. The project utilizes [AWS CloudFormation/CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) to build the stack and once that is created, it uses the SageMaker notebooks created in order to create the endpoint and test it.

(*) NOTE: YOLOv8 is distributed under the GPLv3 license.

For YOLOv5 TensorFlow deployment on SageMaker Endpoint, kindly refer to the [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/host-yolov5-on-sagemaker-endpoint) and the [Blog on YOLOv5 on SageMaker Endpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/scale-yolov5-inference-with-amazon-sagemaker-endpoints-and-aws-lambda/)

## AWS Architecture:

## AWS CloudFormation Stack Creation
The AWS CloudFormation Stack can be created using 2 methods: (1) Using Template or (2) Using AWS CDK. Both the methods are described as follows:

1. Create Stack using AWS CloudFormation:
    - Choose **Launch Stack** and (if prompted) log into your AWS account:
    [![Launch Stack](assets/LaunchStack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://aws-blogs-artifacts-public.s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts/ML-13353/yolov8-pytorch-cfn-template.yaml)
    - Select a unique Stack Name, ackowledge creation of IAM resources, create the stack and wait for a few minutes for it to be successfully deployed

        2. ![Step2_StackIAM](assets/Step2_StackIAM.png)
        3. ![Step3_StackSuccess](assets/Step3_StackSuccess.png)

2. PyTorch YOLOv8 model with AWS CDK
In order to create the stack with AWS CDK, follow the steps highlighted in [yolov8-pytorch-cdk](yolov8-pytorch-cdk/README.md). Use these steps:
```
$ cd yolov8-pytorch-cdk
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ cdk synth
$ cdk bootstrap
$ cdk deploy
```

## YOLOv8 PyTorch model deployment on Amazon SageMaker Endpoints:
- From AWS Console, go to [Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home?region=us-east-1#/notebook-instances)
- Select the Notebook created by the stack and open it
- Inside SageMaker Notebook, navigate: `sm-notebook` and open the notebooks: `1_DeployEndpoint.ipynb` & `2_TestEndpoint.ipynb`
    1. `1_DeployEndpoint.ipynb`: Download YOLOv8 model, zip inference code and model to S3, create SageMaker endpoint and deploy it
    2. `2_TestEndpoint.ipynb`: Test the deployed endpoint by running an image and plotting output; Cleanup the endpoint and hosted model
